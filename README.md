# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This my first Ruby game!👩‍🔬

## To play the game run main.rb
``` sh
ruby main.rb
```

## To change the player's name, set the arguments of Game in main.rb:
```ruby
Main = Game.new('Jane', 'John') # Player's names
```

## Notes
* You can use 'rock' or 'paper' or 'scissors' for your choice.
* The choices are not case-sensitive.
* Don't get suprised if you don't see what you typed, because it's _invisible_.
  (To ensure noone is cheating.😒)

## How to play
1. Type the first user choice. 
2. Type the second user choice.
3. Wait for it!
4. You won! (Or not...)
