# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This my first Ruby game!👩‍🔬

## Playing the game

Run `main.rb`.

```sh
ruby main.rb
```

## How to change the player's name 

Set the arguments of `Game` in `main.rb`.

```ruby
main = Game.new('Jane', 'John') # Player's names
```

## Notes

* You can use:
  * 'rock'
  * 'paper'
  * 'scissors'
  * 'lizard'
  * 'Spock' for your choice.
* The choices are not case-sensitive.
* Don't get suprised if you don't see what you typed, because it's _invisible_.
  (To ensure noone is cheating.😒)
